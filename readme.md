Button Click App

hey guys just started something new today.made a simple app by using some widgets.
learnt alot of new concepts today:

CONSTRAINTS: the widgets that are not constraint on the screen will create problem as
 the android cannot find where to place the widgets ie the widgets will not be be positioned rightly
a) widgets that aren't constraint horizontally will move to the left

b) widgets that aren't constraint vertically will move to the top.

ANCHOR POINT: easch constraint handle can be connected to one anchot pt.
             an anchor pt is a constraint handle to the destination of the constraint
             or an edge of the screen.
             anchor pt can have more that one constraint going to them ie you can constraint
             multiple widgets to the edge of the screen.
