Button Click App

hey guys just started something new today.made a simple app by using some widgets.
learnt alot of new concepts today:

1. CONSTRAINTS: the widgets that are not constraint on the screen will create problem as
 the android cannot find where to place the widgets ie the widgets will not be be positioned rightly.

  a) widgets that aren't constraint horizontally will move to the left

  b) widgets that aren't constraint vertically will move to the top.

2. ANCHOR POINT: easch constraint handle can be connected to one anchot pt.
             an anchor pt is a constraint handle to the destination of the constraint
             or an edge of the screen.
             anchor pt can have more that one constraint going to them ie you can constraint
             multiple widgets to the edge of the screen.

3. just learnt something really intresting abot the android framework and android activities:

4. just learnt some imp java code regarding the button widget and also came to know the working of button
    ie how to make button really work with the help of adding java code to the maiactivity.java file and updated my source code 
    showing working of button in my app when pressed by using the method interface OnClickListner nd making my app work.
    sorce code can be found in my app file if anybody wishes to see.nd can also download the code to see working in your
    android studio.
